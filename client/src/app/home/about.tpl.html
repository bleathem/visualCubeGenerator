    <p>A cube scramble generator and timer</p>

  <h3>What is it?</h3>
  <p>
    <em>Solvi.ca</em> is a tool used to time how long it takes to
    solve a <em>real-life</em> Rubik's style cube.
    Solves are tracked over time allowing you to improvements in your progress.
  </p>
  <h3>What is it not?</h3>
  <p>
    This is <strong>not</strong> a cube simulator, where you solve a virtual
    cube on screen. Such simulators do exist, I recommend
    <a href="https://www.google.ca/webhp#q=rubik's+cube+simulator" target="_new">
      Google
    </a> if that is what you are looking for.
  </p>
  <h3>How does it work?</h3>
  <p>
    On the <em>Scrambles</em> tab, list of cube scrambles is presented.
    Click on a scramble to activate the timer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Across the top of the page you will see a sequence of moves you will execute
    on your <em>real-life</em> cube to achieve the prescribed scramble.
    The notation of
    <code>L</code>, <code>R</code>, <code>F</code>,
    <code>B</code>, <code>U</code>, <code>D</code>
    corresponds to the Left, Right, Front, Back, Upward, Downward faces of the
    cube respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each letter maps to a clockwise turn of the corresponding face, with
    a <code>2</code> indicating that two turns should be executed in sequence.
    A <code>`</code> character indicates a counter-clockwise turn.
  </p>
  <p>
    The spacebar is mapped to the default action on many of the pages.
    It can select a scramble, start/stop the timer, and return to the list of
    scrambles.
